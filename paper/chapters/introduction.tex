“Music is a moral law. It gives a soul to the Universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, a charm to sadness, gaiety and life to everything.
It is the essence of order, and leads to all that is good and just and beautiful.” \cite{quotationDictionary}

\section{Motivation}
Music is a collection of coordinated sounds \cite{whatIsMusic} whose medium is sound,
being one of the first ways of expressing the human had ever had.
From childhood to late adult life, we find ourselves listening to music, according to our feelings:
from babies’ lullabies to calm our little kids,
to the most hyper energetic metal or drum and bass to keep us awake when learning for the finals.

The art of composing music is not one that any beginner can master due to the fact that
music theory has a very steep learning curve.
You can still compose music, without knowing anything about theory,
but it will be very hard to know how to really express your
thoughts since the notes do not have any meaning to you other than their sound.
When you start learning, you will find out about scales,
modes, chords progression and how they clearly relate to some feelings.

\section{Solution Overview}

In the latest years, with the technological advancements regarding artificial intelligence,
dreaming about diagnosing a patient in seconds, facial recognition, instantaneous translating,
and self-driving cars is no longer an idea in Asimov’s mind.
Nowadays, with a bit of work, one can create a neural network,
train it on a given dataset and see the results about its objective,
without needing to worry about the internal structure of each component inside the network.

I want to encourage and help all people that have difficulties composing music with the help of machine learning.
I want to create an application that can compose,
enhance or continue a piece of music based on some emotions that the user can provide.
The music should have a structure and the app will generate
a MIDI file containing a song with the given characteristics.
